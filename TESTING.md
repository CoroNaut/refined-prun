# Welcome to the Refined PrUn beta test!

## What's inside?

### [Changelog](https://github.com/refined-prun/refined-prun/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

**Read it thoroughly (especially the known bug section) so you could
properly test new features/changes and have fewer surprises overall**

## What's expected from you

- Test new features and changes
- Report all bugs you encounter
- Report all feedback and ideas that pop up in your head
- Do not share screenshots and information about this extension publicly. I would like to
  prevent possible confusion and misunderstanding with the public.
- Frequently export your settings/data - this extension is still WIP, so data loss is a possibility

## How to install

1. Export all user data from PMMG
   - `XIT SET`: settings, finances, notes, lists, actions
2. Unpack archive that you received from me
3. Close the game tab
4. Go to Extensions page
5. Disable PMMG (do not remove it) <- this is **very** important
6. Enable developer mode (top right button)
7. Load unpacked extension (top left button) from the unpacked archive.
  You will see a new "Refined PrUn" extension added to your browser.
  Keep "PMMG Extended" disabled.
8. Load the game
9. Import PMMG files via `XIT SET PMMG`
10. Enjoy! If everything works fine, let us know in the chat

**Important: do not move the extracted folder around your file system,
as browser always loads it from this folder**

## How to update extension

I will send you an archive with the new version when it's ready

1. Export all data and settings: settings, finances, notes, lists, actions
2. Close the game tab
3. Backup the folder with the current extension
4. Delete all contents in the folder and then unpack the new archive into it
5. Go to Extensions page
6. Press the âŸ³ button in the Refined PrUn extension tile
7. Load the game

## How to exit the beta program

If you would like to stop the testing and switch back to PMMG, message me in
Discord, and I'll help you migrate the data back to PMMG.
