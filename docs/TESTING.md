properly test new features/changes and have fewer surprises overall**

## What's expected from you

- Test new features and changes

- Report all feedback and ideas that pop up in your head
- Do not share screenshots and information about this extension publicly. I would like to
  prevent possible confusion and misunderstanding with the public.
