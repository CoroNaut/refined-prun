# Welcome to the Refined PrUn beta test!

## What's inside?

### [Changelog](https://github.com/refined-prun/refined-prun/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

**Read it thoroughly (especially the known bug section) so you could
properly test new features/changes and have fewer surprises overall**

## What's expected from you

- Test new features and changes
- Report all bugs you encounter
- Report all feedback and ideas that pop up in your head
- Do not share screenshots and information about this extension publicly. I would like to
  prevent possible confusion and misunderstanding with the public.
- Frequently export your user data - this extension is still WIP, so data loss is a possibility

## How to install

Note: Refined PrUn is a separate extension from PMMG Extended.

1. Create a new folder in your file system, where the new extension will live.
   **Important: do not move this folder around your file system, as the browser will
   run the extension directly from it**
2. Unpack the extension archive into this folder
3. Go to Extensions page in your browser
4. Enable developer mode (top right button)
5. Load unpacked extension (top left button) from the unpacked archive.
   In the file picker, pick the whole folder with the unpacked extension.
   After selecting, you will see a new "Refined PrUn" extension added to your browser.
6. Reload the game
7. Follow the migration guide
8. Enjoy! If everything works fine, let us know in the chat

**Important: do not move the extracted folder around your file system,
as browser always loads it from this folder**

## How to update extension

I will send you an archive with the new version when it's ready

1. Export user data from `XIT SET`
2. Close the game tab
3. Backup the folder with the current extension
4. Delete all contents in the folder and then unpack the new archive into it
5. Go to Extensions page
6. Press the ‚ü≥ button in the Refined PrUn extension tile
7. Load the game

If the game is broken, and no one around to help you fix it, roll the folder contents
to the backup you created in (2).

## How to exit the beta program

If you would like to stop the testing and switch back to PMMG, message me in
Discord, and I'll help you migrate the data back to PMMG.
